In the spring of 2020, L.A. based experimental artist Cleo McKenzie was locked in her bedroom with nothing but an old laptop and a gender identity crisis, the result was TAMAGOTCHI MASSACRE, a ground breaking explosion of glittery pop, trans angst, and distorted guitars.

McKenzie’s experiments quickly found a home in the flourishing internet based genre of Hyperpop, and TAMAGOTCHI MASSACRE began to amass a following, along with an impressive list of co-signs including viral TikTok sensation Glitch Gum, underground pop princess Phixel, and maximalist soundcloud collective GENDERGRIND.

Critics have described some of McKenzie’s work as “pure chip tune madness” (108 Mics), “a chainsaw made of candy” (Ringtone Magazine), and “an addictive amalgamation of power pop riffs and manic Autotune singing” (The Idle Class).  Now, McKenzie is beginning work on her sophomore album while honing her live performance to perfection.
